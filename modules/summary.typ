#cvSection("Summary")

I have experience with Python, Docker, AWS, Git, and GitHub Actions. In my present role, I oversee the development of our telemetry server, manage a group of six engineers, and make sure that all of our procedures are well documented. In my previous role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I managed VPN and reverse SSH servers, maintained and refactored legacy AI systems, and trained object identification models using PyTorch.

I am passionate about delivering value by solving real-world challenges, and I am committed to collaboration, continuous learning, and delivering high-quality results. My diverse experiences enable me to bring valuable perspectives to any team.
